/*what is typedef?
*we can use typedef to give new name to a existing datatype.

eg.

typedefint LENGTH;
* now you can use LENGTH as datatype which same as int.

LENGTH x,y;

we can write this in small letters actually professional use this in capital
letter bcz it is easy in readability.

typedefint length;


length x,y;
