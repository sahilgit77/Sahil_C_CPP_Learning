1. WHILE

clrscr();
while(i<=5) //condition
{
printf("\nSAHIL KHATRI");
i++;        //flow
}
getch();
}

here condition is checking 6 times
1<=5,2<=5,3<=5,4<=5,5<=5,6<=5(here terminated bcz condition is false now)

in while control go inside after checking the codition is true i.e. if condn
is wrong first time then it can't print first time, so while called
entry control loop.

/* 2. DO WHILE

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
main()

int i=1;
clrscr();
do  //do send control in the body of do while
{
printf("\nSAHIL KHATRI");
i++;
} while(i<=5);
getch();
}

here condition is checking 5 times bcz first it is printing then ++(increment)
and then checking first checking 2<=5,3<=5,4<=5,5<=5,6<=5(terminated)

here if condn is false in first time even after this printing one time bcz
here checking done after printin, do while called exit control loop.

/*3. for-in for loop initialization,condition and flow
these allthree works can be done at same place it is good in readability.


it is also entry conrol loop

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
main()
{
int i;
clrscr();
for(i=1;i<=5;i++) //separated by ; and 2 ; compulsory if(2<;>2) then it shows error
{
printf("SAHIL KHATRI\n");
}
getch();
}

in for(i=1;i<=5;i++)
{

}
here control first go on i=1 and then check i<=5 and then go in body of loop
and do printing and after this it comes at i++ and loops continues
